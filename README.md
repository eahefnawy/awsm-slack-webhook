In your JAWS project root directory, run:

```
jaws module install https://github.com/jaws-framework/jaws-core-js
jaws module install https://github.com/eahefnawy/awsm-slack-webhook
```

open `<JAWS project name>/back/aws_modules/awsm-slack-webhook/webhook/index.js` and add your callback code. This is the code that will handle the webhook. Make sure you validate the request depending on your application needs.

when you're done, deploy with:

```
jaws dash
```
After deployment, add this webhook URL to Slack: `<endpoint>/webhooks/slack`, and test it out! Tadaaaa!
