/**
 * !!!!!!!!!!!!!IMPORTANT!!!!!!!!!!!
 *
 * Code in awsm dir of an aws module is just skeletion/example code and CAN be modified by user who installed awsm.
 *
 * Code inside an aws module's 'awsm' dir is copied to project's aws_modules/<mod name> folder (during npm postinstall)
 *
 * Therefore, npm 'dependencies' defined in the module you are creating CAN NOT be used here as node require loader wont
 * be able to find it.
 *
 * For example if awsm-images had a 'dependency' of bluebird defined in its package.json, bluebird could NOT be used
 * in this file.  This file will live in <project>/aws_modules/awsm-images/thumbnail/index.js and the bluebird mod will
 * be included in <project>/node_modules/awsm-images/node_modules/bluebird.
 *
 * In npm v3 dependencies were flattened (https://github.com/npm/npm/releases/tag/v3.0.0) HOWEVER you can still NOT
 * rely on skeletion/example having access to a package the module you are creating depends on because there could be
 * conflicting dependencies (and then your dependency wont be on the flattened path).
 *
 * Keep in mind awsm nodejs mods are just npm modules and should be treated as such.
